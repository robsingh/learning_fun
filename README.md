# Purpose

Goal behind this repository is to streamline the projects I have made so far.
This is going to be a place where all of the code I have written to solidify my fundamentals is present. Some of this was written in 2014 and I have not pushed all of my projects to Git.

However, after years of procrastination I have decided to re-write, add more documentation and context to the projects when I was just beginning to learn to code.
I have tons of Java code, but I am going to convert everything to Python and make it more Pythonic. 

Wish me luck! More to come!
