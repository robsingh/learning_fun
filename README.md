# About this Repository

This repository consolidates projects I’ve built over the years to sharpen my programming fundamentals—some dating back to 2014. Most of the original code was written in Java, but I’m now rewriting it in Python with a focus on clarity, readability, and Pythonic practices.

Each project is being revisited with improved structure, documentation, and context to reflect my growth as a developer. The goal is to turn legacy experiments into clean, maintainable, and well-documented Python code.

Ongoing updates as I convert, refactor, and expand.
It’s a bit of a nostalgic journey—and a fresh start.
